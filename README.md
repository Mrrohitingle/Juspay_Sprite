# 🕹️ Sprite Animation Control Panel

A **ReactJS-based** visual coding environment that allows users to create **sprite animations** through a **drag-and-drop interface**. Inspired by **MIT Scratch**, this project lets users control sprite movements, rotations, and animations effortlessly.

## 📌 Features

### 🎮 Motion Controls:
- **Move**: Move the sprite forward by a specified number of steps.
- **Rotate**: Rotate the sprite clockwise or counterclockwise by a given degree.
- **Go to (X, Y)**: Move the sprite to specific coordinates.
- **Repeat**: Loop an action multiple times.

### 🏗️ Drag and Drop Functionality:
- Users can drag and drop motion blocks into the coding area to control sprite behavior.

### 🎭 Multiple Sprite Support:
- Allows users to create and manage multiple sprites.
- Each sprite can have its independent animation.

### 🔄 Real-time Preview:
- Displays the sprite movement based on user inputs in an interactive **preview area**.

### 🔁 Collision-Based Animation Swap *(Hero Feature)*:
- Swaps animations when two sprites collide.
- Example:
  - **Sprite 1**: Moves **10 steps forward** repeatedly.
  - **Sprite 2**: Moves **-10 steps backward** repeatedly.
  - When they collide, their animations swap.

### 🔂 Looping Mechanism:
- Users can repeat animations for a continuous effect.
